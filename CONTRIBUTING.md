# Contributing to ClaudeSkillz 🚀

Hey there! First off - THANK YOU for even thinking about contributing. Seriously. You're about to make 260+ skills even better, and that's pretty dang cool.

## The Vibe Here

We keep it simple, we keep it real, and we keep it fun. No corporate-speak. No gatekeeping. Just good people building good stuff together.

## Ways to Contribute

### 🐛 Found a Bug?

It happens! Skills break. Dependencies change. Stuff gets weird. Open an issue and tell us what exploded. Bonus points if you:
- Tell us what you expected vs. what actually happened
- Share the error message (they're ugly but useful)
- Let us know your setup (OS, Claude Code version, etc.)

### 💡 Got an Idea?

We LOVE ideas. New skills? Better workflows? Wild improvements? Drop it in [Discussions](https://github.com/jackspace/ClaudeSkillz/discussions) or open an issue. Let's talk it through.

### 🛠️ Want to Add a Skill?

THIS IS THE GOOD STUFF. Here's how:

1. **Fork it** - Grab your own copy of the repo
2. **Create your skill** - Drop it in `skills/your-amazing-skill/`
3. **Follow the structure**:
   ```
   your-skill-name/
   ├── SKILL.md or SKILL.json
   └── README.md (optional but nice)
   ```
4. **Keep it clean** - No real API keys, passwords, or secrets. Use `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` and friends
5. **Test it** - Make sure it actually works in Claude Code
6. **PR it** - Submit that pull request with pride

### ✨ Improving Existing Skills?

YES PLEASE. Fix that typo. Clarify that confusing section. Add a better example. Submit a PR and let's ship it.

## Skill Guidelines (The Important Stuff)

- **Names matter** - Use clear, descriptive names like `docker-helper` not `dh`
- **Examples are everything** - Show people how to actually use it
- **Placeholders only** - Replace all real credentials with obvious placeholders
- **Test before submit** - Does it work? Does it *really* work?
- **Security first** - If your skill touches sensitive stuff, call it out clearly

## The PR Process

1. You submit → We review (usually fast)
2. We might have questions → You answer (no stress)
3. Looks good? → MERGE 🎉
4. Your skill goes live → Thousands of people benefit

## Code of Conduct (AKA Don't Be That Person)

Be cool. Be kind. Be helpful. We're all here to build something awesome together. No jerks allowed.

## Questions?

Stuck? Confused? Not sure if your idea fits? Just ask! Open an issue, start a discussion, or reach out. We're friendly, I promise.

## Recognition

Every contributor gets:
- Credit in the commit history (forever)
- Our eternal gratitude (priceless)
- The satisfaction of helping thousands of Claude Code users (pretty cool)
