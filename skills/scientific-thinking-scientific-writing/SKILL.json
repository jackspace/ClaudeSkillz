    "Overview": "Scientific writing is a process for communicating research with precision and clarity. Write manuscripts using IMRAD structure, citations (APA/AMA/Vancouver), figures/tables, and reporting guidelines (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA). Apply this skill for research papers and journal submissions.",
    "When to Use This Skill": "This skill should be used when:\r\n- Writing or revising any section of a scientific manuscript (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion)\r\n- Structuring a research paper using IMRAD or other standard formats\r\n- Formatting citations and references in specific styles (APA, AMA, Vancouver, Chicago, IEEE)\r\n- Creating, formatting, or improving figures, tables, and data visualizations\r\n- Applying study-specific reporting guidelines (CONSORT for trials, STROBE for observational studies, PRISMA for reviews)\r\n- Drafting abstracts that meet journal requirements (structured or unstructured)\r\n- Preparing manuscripts for submission to specific journals\r\n- Improving writing clarity, conciseness, and precision\r\n- Ensuring proper use of field-specific terminology and nomenclature\r\n- Addressing reviewer comments and revising manuscripts",
    "Core Capabilities": "### 1. Manuscript Structure and Organization\r\n\r\n**IMRAD Format**: Guide papers through the standard Introduction, Methods, Results, And Discussion structure used across most scientific disciplines. This includes:\r\n- **Introduction**: Establish research context, identify gaps, state objectives\r\n- **Methods**: Detail study design, populations, procedures, and analysis approaches\r\n- **Results**: Present findings objectively without interpretation\r\n- **Discussion**: Interpret results, acknowledge limitations, propose future directions\r\n\r\nFor detailed guidance on IMRAD structure, refer to `references/imrad_structure.md`.\r\n\r\n**Alternative Structures**: Support discipline-specific formats including:\r\n- Review articles (narrative, systematic, scoping)\r\n- Case reports and case series\r\n- Meta-analyses and pooled analyses\r\n- Theoretical/modeling papers\r\n- Methods papers and protocols\r\n\r\n### 2. Section-Specific Writing Guidance\r\n\r\n**Abstract Composition**: Craft concise, standalone summaries (100-250 words) that capture the paper's purpose, methods, results, and conclusions. Support both structured abstracts (with labeled sections) and unstructured single-paragraph formats.\r\n\r\n**Introduction Development**: Build compelling introductions that:\r\n- Establish the research problem's importance\r\n- Review relevant literature systematically\r\n- Identify knowledge gaps or controversies\r\n- State clear research questions or hypotheses\r\n- Explain the study's novelty and significance\r\n\r\n**Methods Documentation**: Ensure reproducibility through:\r\n- Detailed participant/sample descriptions\r\n- Clear procedural documentation\r\n- Statistical methods with justification\r\n- Equipment and materials specifications\r\n- Ethical approval and consent statements\r\n\r\n**Results Presentation**: Present findings with:\r\n- Logical flow from primary to secondary outcomes\r\n- Integration with figures and tables\r\n- Statistical significance with effect sizes\r\n- Objective reporting without interpretation\r\n\r\n**Discussion Construction**: Synthesize findings by:\r\n- Relating results to research questions\r\n- Comparing with existing literature\r\n- Acknowledging limitations honestly\r\n- Proposing mechanistic explanations\r\n- Suggesting practical implications and future research\r\n\r\n### 3.

For comprehensive style guides, refer to `references/citation_styles.md`.\r\n\r\n**Major Citation Styles:**\r\n- **AMA (American Medical Association)**: Numbered superscript citations, common in medicine\r\n- **Vancouver**: Numbered citations in square brackets, biomedical standard\r\n- **APA (American Psychological Association)**: Author-date in-text citations, common in social sciences\r\n- **Chicago**: Notes-bibliography or author-date, humanities and sciences\r\n- **IEEE**: Numbered square brackets, engineering and computer science\r\n\r\n**Best Practices:**\r\n- Cite primary sources when possible\r\n- Include recent literature (last 5-10 years for active fields)\r\n- Balance citation distribution across introduction and discussion\r\n- Verify all citations against original sources\r\n- Use reference management software (Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote)\r\n\r\n### 4. Figures and Tables\r\n\r\nCreate effective data visualizations that enhance comprehension. For detailed best practices, refer to `references/figures_tables.md`.\r\n\r\n**When to Use Tables vs. Figures:**\r\n- **Tables**: Precise numerical data, complex datasets, multiple variables requiring exact values\r\n- **Figures**: Trends, patterns, relationships, comparisons best understood visually\r\n\r\n**Design Principles:**\r\n- Make each table/figure self-explanatory with complete captions\r\n- Use consistent formatting and terminology across all display items\r\n- Label all axes, columns, and rows with units\r\n- Include sample sizes (n) and statistical annotations\r\n- Follow the \"one table/figure per 1000 words\" guideline\r\n- Avoid duplicating information between text, tables, and figures\r\n\r\n**Common Figure Types:**\r\n- Bar graphs: Comparing discrete categories\r\n- Line graphs: Showing trends over time\r\n- Scatterplots: Displaying correlations\r\n- Box plots: Showing distributions and outliers\r\n- Heatmaps: Visualizing matrices and patterns\r\n\r\n### 5. Reporting Guidelines by Study Type\r\n\r\nEnsure completeness and transparency by following established reporting standards. For comprehensive guideline details, refer to `references/reporting_guidelines.md`.\r\n\r\n**Key Guidelines:**\r\n- **CONSORT**: Randomized controlled trials\r\n- **STROBE**: Observational studies (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional)\r\n- **PRISMA**: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses\r\n- **STARD**: Diagnostic accuracy studies\r\n- **TRIPOD**: Prediction model studies\r\n- **ARRIVE**: Animal research\r\n- **CARE**: Case reports\r\n- **SQUIRE**: Quality improvement studies\r\n- **SPIRIT**: Study protocols for clinical trials\r\n- **CHEERS**: Economic evaluations\r\n\r\nEach guideline provides checklists ensuring all critical methodological elements are reported.\r\n\r\n### 6.
