    "Limitations and Considerations": "1. **API is for exploratory queries:** For systematic analyses of many targets/diseases, use data downloads or BigQuery\r\n2. **Scores are relative, not absolute:** Association scores rank evidence strength but don't predict clinical success\r\n3. **Under-studied diseases score lower:** Novel or rare diseases may have strong evidence but lower aggregate scores\r\n4. **Evidence quality varies:** Weight expert-curated sources higher than computational predictions\r\n5. **Requires biological interpretation:** Scores and evidence must be interpreted in biological and clinical context\r\n6. **No authentication required:** All data is freely accessible, but cite appropriately",
    "Overview": "The Open Targets Platform is a comprehensive resource for systematic identification and prioritization of potential therapeutic drug targets. It integrates publicly available datasets including human genetics, omics, literature, and chemical data to build and score target-disease associations.\r\n\r\n**Key capabilities:**\r\n- Query target (gene) annotations including tractability, safety, expression\r\n- Search for disease-target associations with evidence scores\r\n- Retrieve evidence from multiple data types (genetics, pathways, literature, etc.)\r\n- Find known drugs for diseases and their mechanisms\r\n- Access drug information including clinical trial phases and adverse events\r\n- Evaluate target druggability and therapeutic potential\r\n\r\n**Data access:** The platform provides a GraphQL API, web interface, data downloads, and Google BigQuery access. This skill focuses on the GraphQL API for programmatic access.",
    "Best Practices": "### Target Prioritization Strategy\r\n\r\nWhen prioritizing drug targets:\r\n\r\n1. **Start with genetic evidence:** Human genetics (GWAS, rare variants) provides strongest disease relevance\r\n2. **Check tractability:** Prefer targets with clinical or discovery precedence\r\n3. **Assess safety:** Review safety liabilities, expression patterns, and genetic constraint\r\n4. **Evaluate clinical precedence:** Known drugs indicate druggability and therapeutic window\r\n5. **Consider multiple evidence types:** Convergent evidence from different sources increases confidence\r\n6. **Validate mechanistically:** Pathway evidence and biological plausibility\r\n7. **Review literature manually:** For critical decisions, examine primary publications\r\n\r\n### Evidence Interpretation\r\n\r\n**Strong evidence indicators:**\r\n- Multiple independent evidence sources\r\n- High genetic association scores (especially GWAS with L2G > 0.5)\r\n- Clinical precedence from approved drugs\r\n- ClinVar pathogenic variants with disease match\r\n- Mouse models with relevant phenotypes\r\n\r\n**Caution flags:**\r\n- Single evidence source only\r\n- Text-mining as sole evidence (requires manual validation)\r\n- Conflicting evidence across sources\r\n- High essentiality + ubiquitous expression (poor therapeutic window)\r\n- Multiple safety liabilities\r\n\r\n**Score interpretation:**\r\n- Scores rank relative strength, not absolute confidence\r\n- Under-studied diseases have lower scores despite potentially valid targets\r\n- Weight expert-curated sources higher than computational predictions\r\n- Check evidence breakdown, not just overall score\r\n\r\n### Common Workflows\r\n\r\n**Workflow 1: Target Discovery for a Disease**\r\n1. Search for disease → get EFO ID\r\n2. Query disease info with `include_targets=True`\r\n3. Review top targets sorted by association score\r\n4. For promising targets, get detailed target info\r\n5. Examine evidence types supporting each association\r\n6. Assess tractability and safety for prioritized targets\r\n\r\n**Workflow 2: Target Validation**\r\n1. Search for target → get Ensembl ID\r\n2. Get comprehensive target info\r\n3. Check tractability (especially clinical precedence)\r\n4. Review safety liabilities and genetic constraint\r\n5. Examine disease associations to understand biology\r\n6. Look for chemical probes or tool compounds\r\n7. Check known drugs targeting gene for mechanism insights\r\n\r\n**Workflow 3: Drug Repurposing**\r\n1. Search for disease → get EFO ID\r\n2. Get known drugs for disease\r\n3. For each drug, get detailed drug info\r\n4. Examine mechanisms of action and targets\r\n5. Look for related disease indications\r\n6. Assess clinical trial phases and status\r\n7. Identify repurposing opportunities based on mechanism\r\n\r\n**Workflow 4: Competitive Intelligence**\r\n1. Search for target of interest\r\n2. Get associated diseases with evidence\r\n3. For each disease, get known drugs\r\n4. Review clinical phases and development status\r\n5. Identify competitors and their mechanisms\r\n6. Assess clinical precedence and market landscape",
