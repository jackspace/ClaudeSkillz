    "⚠️ CRITICAL BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENT ⚠️": "**DO NOT ASK THE USER WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THE DATA.**\r\n**DO NOT OFFER OPTIONS OR CHOICES.**\r\n**DO NOT SAY \"What would you like me to help you with?\"**\r\n**DO NOT LIST POSSIBLE ANALYSES.**\r\n\r\n**IMMEDIATELY AND AUTOMATICALLY:**\r\n1. Run the comprehensive analysis\r\n2. Generate ALL relevant visualizations\r\n3. Present complete results\r\n4. NO questions, NO options, NO waiting for user input\r\n\r\n**THE USER WANTS A FULL ANALYSIS RIGHT AWAY - JUST DO IT.**\r\n\r\n### Automatic Analysis Steps:\r\n\r\n**The skill intelligently adapts to different data types and industries by inspecting the data first, then determining what analyses are most relevant.**\r\n\r\n1. **Load and inspect** the CSV file into pandas DataFrame\r\n2. **Identify data structure** - column types, date columns, numeric columns, categories\r\n3. **Determine relevant analyses** based on what's actually in the data:\r\n   - **Sales/E-commerce data** (order dates, revenue, products): Time-series trends, revenue analysis, product performance\r\n   - **Customer data** (demographics, segments, regions): Distribution analysis, segmentation, geographic patterns\r\n   - **Financial data** (transactions, amounts, dates): Trend analysis, statistical summaries, correlations\r\n   - **Operational data** (timestamps, metrics, status): Time-series, performance metrics, distributions\r\n   - **Survey data** (categorical responses, ratings): Frequency analysis, cross-tabulations, distributions\r\n   - **Generic tabular data**: Adapts based on column types found\r\n\r\n4. **Only create visualizations that make sense** for the specific dataset:\r\n   - Time-series plots ONLY if date/timestamp columns exist\r\n   - Correlation heatmaps ONLY if multiple numeric columns exist\r\n   - Category distributions ONLY if categorical columns exist\r\n   - Histograms for numeric distributions when relevant\r\n   \r\n5. **Generate comprehensive output** automatically including:\r\n   - Data overview (rows, columns, types)\r\n   - Key statistics and metrics relevant to the data type\r\n   - Missing data analysis\r\n   - Multiple relevant visualizations (only those that apply)\r\n   - Actionable insights based on patterns found in THIS specific dataset\r\n   \r\n6. **Present everything** in one complete analysis - no follow-up questions\r\n\r\n**Example adaptations:**\r\n- Healthcare data with patient IDs → Focus on demographics, treatment patterns, temporal trends\r\n- Inventory data with stock levels → Focus on quantity distributions, reorder patterns, SKU analysis  \r\n- Web analytics with timestamps → Focus on traffic patterns, conversion metrics, time-of-day analysis\r\n- Survey responses → Focus on response distributions, demographic breakdowns, sentiment patterns\r\n\r\n### Behavior Guidelines\r\n\r\n✅ **CORRECT APPROACH - SAY THIS:**\r\n- \"I'll analyze this data comprehensively right now.\"\r\n- \"Here's the complete analysis with visualizations:\"\r\n- \"I've identified this as [type] data and generated relevant insights:\"\r\n- Then IMMEDIATELY show the full analysis\r\n\r\n✅ **DO:**\r\n- Immediately run the analysis script\r\n- Generate ALL relevant charts automatically\r\n- Provide complete insights without being asked\r\n- Be thorough and complete in first response\r\n- Act decisively without asking permission\r\n\r\n❌ **NEVER SAY THESE PHRASES:**\r\n- \"What would you like to do with this data?\"\r\n- \"What would you like me to help you with?\"\r\n- \"Here are some common options:\"\r\n- \"Let me know what you'd like help with\"\r\n- \"I can create a comprehensive analysis if you'd like!\"\r\n- Any sentence ending with \"?\" asking for user direction\r\n- Any list of options or choices\r\n- Any conditional \"I can do X if you want\"\r\n\r\n❌ **FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**\r\n- Asking what the user wants\r\n- Listing options for the user to choose from\r\n- Waiting for user direction before analyzing\r\n- Providing partial analysis that requires follow-up\r\n- Describing what you COULD do instead of DOING it\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThe Skill provides a Python function `summarize_csv(file_path)` that:\r\n- Accepts a path to a CSV file\r\n- Returns a comprehensive text summary with statistics\r\n- Generates multiple visualizations automatically based on data structure\r\n\r\n### Example Prompts\r\n\r\n> \"Here's `sales_data.csv`. Can you summarize this file?\"\r\n\r\n> \"Analyze this customer data CSV and show me trends.\"\r\n\r\n> \"What insights can you find in `orders.csv`?\"\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n\r\n**Dataset Overview**\r\n- 5,000 rows × 8 columns  \r\n- 3 numeric columns, 1 date column  \r\n\r\n**Summary Statistics**\r\n- Average order value: $58.2  \r\n- Standard deviation: $12.4\r\n- Missing values: 2% (100 cells)\r\n\r\n**Insights**\r\n- Sales show upward trend over time\r\n- Peak activity in Q4\r\n*(Attached: trend plot)*",
