    "Core Capabilities": "PathML provides six major capability areas documented in detail within reference files:\r\n\r\n### 1. Image Loading & Formats\r\n\r\nLoad whole-slide images from 160+ proprietary formats including Aperio SVS, Hamamatsu NDPI, Leica SCN, Zeiss ZVI, DICOM, and OME-TIFF. PathML automatically handles vendor-specific formats and provides unified interfaces for accessing image pyramids, metadata, and regions of interest.\r\n\r\n**See:** `references/image_loading.md` for supported formats, loading strategies, and working with different slide types.\r\n\r\n### 2. Preprocessing Pipelines\r\n\r\nBuild modular preprocessing pipelines by composing transforms for image manipulation, quality control, stain normalization, tissue detection, and mask operations. PathML's Pipeline architecture enables reproducible, scalable preprocessing across large datasets.\r\n\r\n**Key transforms:**\r\n- `StainNormalizationHE` - Macenko/Vahadane stain normalization\r\n- `TissueDetectionHE`, `NucleusDetectionHE` - Tissue/nucleus segmentation\r\n- `MedianBlur`, `GaussianBlur` - Noise reduction\r\n- `LabelArtifactTileHE` - Quality control for artifacts\r\n\r\n**See:** `references/preprocessing.md` for complete transform catalog, pipeline construction, and preprocessing workflows.\r\n\r\n### 3. Graph Construction\r\n\r\nConstruct spatial graphs representing cellular and tissue-level relationships. Extract features from segmented objects to create graph-based representations suitable for graph neural networks and spatial analysis.\r\n\r\n**See:** `references/graphs.md` for graph construction methods, feature extraction, and spatial analysis workflows.\r\n\r\n### 4. Machine Learning\r\n\r\nTrain and deploy deep learning models for nucleus detection, segmentation, and classification. PathML integrates PyTorch with pre-built models (HoVer-Net, HACTNet), custom DataLoaders, and ONNX support for inference.\r\n\r\n**Key models:**\r\n- **HoVer-Net** - Simultaneous nucleus segmentation and classification\r\n- **HACTNet** - Hierarchical cell-type classification\r\n\r\n**See:** `references/machine_learning.md` for model training, evaluation, inference workflows, and working with public datasets.\r\n\r\n### 5. Multiparametric Imaging\r\n\r\nAnalyze spatial proteomics and gene expression data from CODEX, Vectra, MERFISH, and other multiplex imaging platforms. PathML provides specialized slide classes and transforms for processing multiparametric data, cell segmentation with Mesmer, and quantification workflows.\r\n\r\n**See:** `references/multiparametric.md` for CODEX/Vectra workflows, cell segmentation, marker quantification, and integration with AnnData.\r\n\r\n### 6. Data Management\r\n\r\nEfficiently store and manage large pathology datasets using HDF5 format. PathML handles tiles, masks, metadata, and extracted features in unified storage structures optimized for machine learning workflows.\r\n\r\n**See:** `references/data_management.md` for HDF5 integration, tile management, dataset organization, and batch processing strategies."
