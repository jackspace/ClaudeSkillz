    "When To Apply": "**ALWAYS before:**\r\n- ANY variation of success/completion claims\r\n- ANY expression of satisfaction\r\n- ANY positive statement about work state\r\n- Committing, PR creation, task completion\r\n- Moving to next task\r\n- Delegating to agents\r\n\r\n**Rule applies to:**\r\n- Exact phrases\r\n- Paraphrases and synonyms\r\n- Implications of success\r\n- ANY communication suggesting completion/correctness",
    "Overview": "Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.\r\n\r\n**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.\r\n\r\n**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**",
    "The Iron Law": "```\r\nNO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.",
    "Common Failures": "| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |\r\n|-------|----------|----------------|\r\n| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, \"should pass\" |\r\n| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |\r\n| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |\r\n| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |\r\n| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once |\r\n| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports \"success\" |\r\n| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |",
    "Why This Matters": "From 24 failure memories:\r\n- your human partner said \"I don't believe you\" - trust broken\r\n- Undefined functions shipped - would crash\r\n- Missing requirements shipped - incomplete features\r\n- Time wasted on false completion → redirect → rework\r\n- Violates: \"Honesty is a core value. If you lie, you'll be replaced.\"",
    "The Bottom Line": "**No shortcuts for verification.**\r\n\r\nRun the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.\r\n\r\nThis is non-negotiable.",
    "Rationalization Prevention": "| Excuse | Reality |\r\n|--------|---------|\r\n| \"Should work now\" | RUN the verification |\r\n| \"I'm confident\" | Confidence ≠ evidence |\r\n| \"Just this once\" | No exceptions |\r\n| \"Linter passed\" | Linter ≠ compiler |\r\n| \"Agent said success\" | Verify independently |\r\n| \"I'm tired\" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse |\r\n| \"Partial check is enough\" | Partial proves nothing |\r\n| \"Different words so rule doesn't apply\" | Spirit over letter |",
    "The Gate Function": "```\r\nBEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:\r\n\r\n1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?\r\n2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)\r\n3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures\r\n4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?\r\n   - If NO: State actual status with evidence\r\n   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence\r\n5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim\r\n\r\nSkip any step = lying, not verifying\r\n```",
    "Key Patterns": "**Tests:**\r\n```\r\n✅ [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] \"All tests pass\"\r\n❌ \"Should pass now\" / \"Looks correct\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**\r\n```\r\n✅ Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)\r\n❌ \"I've written a regression test\" (without red-green verification)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Build:**\r\n```\r\n✅ [Run build] [See: exit 0] \"Build passes\"\r\n❌ \"Linter passed\" (linter doesn't check compilation)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Requirements:**\r\n```\r\n✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion\r\n❌ \"Tests pass, phase complete\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Agent delegation:**\r\n```\r\n✅ Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state\r\n❌ Trust agent report\r\n```",
    "Red Flags - STOP": "- Using \"should\", \"probably\", \"seems to\"\r\n- Expressing satisfaction before verification (\"Great!\", \"Perfect!\", \"Done!\", etc.)\r\n- About to commit/push/PR without verification\r\n- Trusting agent success reports\r\n- Relying on partial verification\r\n- Thinking \"just this once\"\r\n- Tired and wanting work over\r\n- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**"
