    "Workflow": "Follow this systematic process to generate robust scientific hypotheses:\r\n\r\n### 1. Understand the Phenomenon\r\n\r\nStart by clarifying the observation, question, or phenomenon that requires explanation:\r\n\r\n- Identify the core observation or pattern that needs explanation\r\n- Define the scope and boundaries of the phenomenon\r\n- Note any constraints or specific contexts\r\n- Clarify what is already known vs. what is uncertain\r\n- Identify the relevant scientific domain(s)\r\n\r\n### 2. Conduct Comprehensive Literature Search\r\n\r\nSearch existing scientific literature to ground hypotheses in current evidence. Use both PubMed (for biomedical topics) and general web search (for broader scientific domains):\r\n\r\n**For biomedical topics:**\r\n- Use WebFetch with PubMed URLs to access relevant literature\r\n- Search for recent reviews, meta-analyses, and primary research\r\n- Look for similar phenomena, related mechanisms, or analogous systems\r\n\r\n**For all scientific domains:**\r\n- Use WebSearch to find recent papers, preprints, and reviews\r\n- Search for established theories, mechanisms, or frameworks\r\n- Identify gaps in current understanding\r\n\r\n**Search strategy:**\r\n- Begin with broad searches to understand the landscape\r\n- Narrow to specific mechanisms, pathways, or theories\r\n- Look for contradictory findings or unresolved debates\r\n- Consult `references/literature_search_strategies.md` for detailed search techniques\r\n\r\n### 3. Synthesize Existing Evidence\r\n\r\nAnalyze and integrate findings from literature search:\r\n\r\n- Summarize current understanding of the phenomenon\r\n- Identify established mechanisms or theories that may apply\r\n- Note conflicting evidence or alternative viewpoints\r\n- Recognize gaps, limitations, or unanswered questions\r\n- Identify analogies from related systems or domains\r\n\r\n### 4. Generate Competing Hypotheses\r\n\r\nDevelop 3-5 distinct hypotheses that could explain the phenomenon. Each hypothesis should:\r\n\r\n- Provide a mechanistic explanation (not just description)\r\n- Be distinguishable from other hypotheses\r\n- Draw on evidence from the literature synthesis\r\n- Consider different levels of explanation (molecular, cellular, systemic, population, etc.)\r\n\r\n**Strategies for generating hypotheses:**\r\n- Apply known mechanisms from analogous systems\r\n- Consider multiple causative pathways\r\n- Explore different scales of explanation\r\n- Question assumptions in existing explanations\r\n- Combine mechanisms in novel ways\r\n\r\n### 5. Evaluate Hypothesis Quality\r\n\r\nAssess each hypothesis against established quality criteria from `references/hypothesis_quality_criteria.md`:\r\n\r\n**Testability:** Can the hypothesis be empirically tested?\r\n**Falsifiability:** What observations would disprove it?\r\n**Parsimony:** Is it the simplest explanation that fits the evidence?\r\n**Explanatory Power:** How much of the phenomenon does it explain?\r\n**Scope:** What range of observations does it cover?\r\n**Consistency:** Does it align with established principles?\r\n**Novelty:** Does it offer new insights beyond existing explanations?\r\n\r\nExplicitly note the strengths and weaknesses of each hypothesis.\r\n\r\n### 6. Design Experimental Tests\r\n\r\nFor each viable hypothesis, propose specific experiments or studies to test it. Consult `references/experimental_design_patterns.md` for common approaches:\r\n\r\n**Experimental design elements:**\r\n- What would be measured or observed?\r\n- What comparisons or controls are needed?\r\n- What methods or techniques would be used?\r\n- What sample sizes or statistical approaches are appropriate?\r\n- What are potential confounds and how to address them?\r\n\r\n**Consider multiple approaches:**\r\n- Laboratory experiments (in vitro, in vivo, computational)\r\n- Observational studies (cross-sectional, longitudinal, case-control)\r\n- Clinical trials (if applicable)\r\n- Natural experiments or quasi-experimental designs\r\n\r\n### 7. Formulate Testable Predictions\r\n\r\nFor each hypothesis, generate specific, quantitative predictions:\r\n\r\n- State what should be observed if the hypothesis is correct\r\n- Specify expected direction and magnitude of effects when possible\r\n- Identify conditions under which predictions should hold\r\n- Distinguish predictions between competing hypotheses\r\n- Note predictions that would falsify the hypothesis\r\n\r\n### 8. Present Structured Output\r\n\r\nUse the template in `assets/hypothesis_output_template.md` to present hypotheses in a clear, consistent format:\r\n\r\n**Standard structure:**\r\n1. **Background & Context** - Phenomenon and literature summary\r\n2. **Competing Hypotheses** - Enumerated hypotheses with mechanistic explanations\r\n3. **Quality Assessment** - Evaluation of each hypothesis\r\n4. **Experimental Designs** - Proposed tests for each hypothesis\r\n5. **Testable Predictions** - Specific, measurable predictions\r\n6. **Critical Comparisons** - How to distinguish between hypotheses",
    "Overview": "Hypothesis generation is a systematic process for developing testable explanations. Formulate evidence-based hypotheses from observations, design experiments, explore competing explanations, and develop predictions. Apply this skill for scientific inquiry across domains.",

    "Quality Standards": "Ensure all generated hypotheses meet these standards:\r\n\r\n- **Evidence-based:** Grounded in existing literature with citations\r\n- **Testable:** Include specific, measurable predictions\r\n- **Mechanistic:** Explain how/why, not just what\r\n- **Comprehensive:** Consider alternative explanations\r\n- **Rigorous:** Include experimental designs to test predictions"
